            The Sustainability Cell in association with the Hostel Affairs
            Council, IIT Bombay have launched the waste bin segregation
            initiative in the institute. This initiative promotes environmental
            sustainability by facilitating the efficient disposal and recycling
            of waste materials, reducing the overall carbon footprint of the
            campus. This practice enhances resource conservation, as separated
            waste streams can be processed more effectively, diverting
            recyclable materials away from landfills.
            <!--Additionally, a culture of waste bin
                            segregation fosters awareness and responsible waste management among the IIT Bombay community, contributing to
