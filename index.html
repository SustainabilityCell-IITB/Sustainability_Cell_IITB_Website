            The Sustainability Cell in association with the Hostel Affairs

            campus. This practice enhances resource conservation, as separated
            waste streams can be processed more effectively, diverting

          <h3>Carbon Footprinting</h3>
          <p>
            We are working with Professors Vikram Vishal (Earth Science) and
            Arnab Dutta (Chemistry) to gather information and perform a thorough
            carbon footprint assessment of the IIT Bombay campus in order to
            benchmark the institute's development and create suggestions for
            enhancing our carbon performance. The emission breakup is :- 95%
            from Scope 2, 4.4% from Scope 1 and 0.6% from Scope 3.

          <h3>IITB Half Marathon</h3>
          <p>
            At the IITB Half Marathon on October 30th, #BreatheBetterMumbai took
            center stage, driving awareness on air pollution. Emphasizing
            sustainability, we partnered with a certified recycling organization
            for plastic bottle recycling and utilized waste cycle cardboard
            boxes to convey powerful air pollution messages. The event featured
            inspiring displays of winning projects from Airathon Mumbai,
            reflecting our collective strides towards a cleaner, healthier
            Mumbai.

            The association is dedicated to educating housekeeping staff,
            students, and teaching staff on responsible plastic usage and
            recycling. This involves sensitizing individuals about proper
            plastic disposal, ensuring regular collection for recycling, and
            maintaining a yearly database of plastic collection on campus. The
            collaboration with Bisleri signifies a commitment to sustainability,
            with a focus on raising awareness and fostering a sense of
            responsibility among participants and students for future
            environmental conservation.
          </p>
          <p>
            As part of this initiative, the association has actively supported
            Bisleri in promoting awareness, emphasizing the importance of
            recycling, reducing, and reusing plastic materials. They have
            showcased examples of transformed plastic into environmentally
            responsible products, providing a hands-on understanding of the
            recycling process. This collective effort aims to make a positive
            impact on their mission to promote sustainability and responsible
            environmental practices.
